!-- DISABLE
# Hello, and thank you for using my plugin, Scripted Events!
# I'm going to go over a couple of brief things in here you should know about setting up scripts. It's relatively easy!
# First and foremost, the GitHub's wiki is stocked full of information about different things you can do! I strongly encourage using this resource.
# Additionally, this folder will generate on server startup full of already-functioning scripts. You do not have to keep them, and you can delete the ScriptedEvents folder to re-generate them.
# All scripts in this folder can be loaded and executed by running "script ex [filename]" in-game (without the .txt extension).
# Example: To run this file, type "script ex README" in the RemoteAdmin panel.
# 'script.execute' permission is required to execute scripts (unless specified otherwise in config).
# Any line starting with a # will be ignored and can be used to comment what you're doing, TODOs, etc.
# Adding "!-- DISABLE" at the start of the script will disable its execution in-game. Useful for WIP/broken scripts.
# Each action that takes a 'duration' parameter supports math, which means you can use math equations such as '5 * 5'.
# Each action that supports math also supports variables, eg. '5 * {PLAYERSALIVE}' to multiply 5 by the amount of players alive.

# This plugin contains A LOT of features. You will likely get confused at first. That's okay, that's why documentation (and support) is here.
# If you ever get stuck, the HELP action is here for you. Simply input "HELP [action name/variable name]" into a script to get detailed info about how it works.
# Or type "HELP LIST" for a list of actions, or "HELP LISTVAR" for a list of variables.

# Lastly, have fun! This is meant to be a fun plugin to mess around with, as well as a utility plugin to create what you can imagine without the need for a custom plugin.
# If you have any questions, do not hesitate to join the Discord server and ask! I'm here to help you!
